🌳 The Whispering Tree

In a quiet village nestled between two hills, there stood an ancient tree known as the Whispering Tree. It wasn’t just any tree—it was said to murmur secrets to those who dared to listen closely.

Twelve-year-old Mira had always been curious. One windy afternoon, with the sun just beginning to dip behind the hills, she tiptoed to the tree. She placed her ear against its bark.

To her surprise, she heard a whisper.

    “The key is buried beneath the old swing.”

Heart pounding with excitement, Mira ran to the forgotten swing hanging from a low branch on the other side of the tree. Digging quickly with her hands, she uncovered a small rusted box. Inside was a golden key—and a note:

    “To the one who listens: follow the fireflies.”

That night, she followed a glowing trail of fireflies deep into the forest. There, hidden beneath vines and moss, she found an old wooden door built into a hill. She held up the golden key—and the door slowly creaked open...

And from that day on, Mira was never quite the same. Because some doors, once opened, lead to worlds you only read about in dreams.
